= SMART COSMOS Validation

Validation constraint annotations and validators.  This is a collection of annotations useful for constraint validation.

== @ExclusiveField

The `@ExclusiveField()` annotation is a class-level annotation that ensures only one of possibly alternative fields is defined.

For that, it requires an array of field names as parameter:
....
@ExclusiveField(fields = { "foo", "bar" })
public class Entity {
    private String foo;
    private String bar;
    private String someOtherField;
}
....

Validation passes if one of the specified fields is neither `null` or empty.


== @NotEmpty

The `@NotEmpty` annotation is a class-level annotation that ensures a String is neither `null` or blank.
